        The Cloth Shop has been a Vancouver favourite fabric and quilt shop for over thirty-five years! It is owned by Maria Roder and Barbara Jean Paxton. Being chosen a Quilt Sampler Top 10 Quilt Shop was quite a thrill! We've had various accolades over the years and are known for our attention to detail in our inspiring in store displays, choosing prints and colour, as well as creating beautiful and unique projects.

        We love working in the latest fabrics, creating kits and our own pattern line.  Our Bella Moon patterns are available in store, on line and at many other shops across Canada and into the United States.  Wholesale inquires welcome.

        After thirty years on Upper Tenth Avenue, we moved to the wonderful, artsy Granville Island in 2012.

        Granville Island is located on territories that are the ancestral lands for three local  nations, the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish) and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh).

        We take pride in making our store enchanting, inspiring and ever changing, and hope you'll find our web site as inviting!

        Thank you for visiting ~ Maria and Barbara Jean
